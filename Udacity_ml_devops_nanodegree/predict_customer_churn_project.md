## Project Instructions

You will not need to write code for this project completely from scratch. There is a notebook called **churn_notebook.ipynb** code that you will need to refactor to follow best practices. There are three files you will need to complete for this project:

    churn_library.py
    churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
    README.md

You are welcome to add functions that you need to complete the project, but you should also be able to complete the project simply using the functions available. You will see that the document strings have already been created for all the functions in the churn_library.py to assist with one potential solution.


## Submission Instructions

You can submit through the workspace itself (preferred) or you can provide a Github link to your completed project.

The project requires completed versions of:

    churn_library.py
    churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
    README.md

The file structure of a completed project should be similar to the below: (ref image)
