# Production code: 
### Software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note that this is different from production-quality code, which describes code that meets expectations for production in reliability, efficiency, and other aspects. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.

# Clean code: 
### Code that is readable, simple, and concise. Clean production-quality code is crucial for collaboration and maintainability in software development.

# Modular code: 
### Code that is logically broken up into functions and modules. Modular production-quality code that makes your code more organized, efficient, and reusable.

# Module: 
### A file. Modules allow code to be reused by encapsulating them into files that can be imported into other files.

# Efficient Code

## Execute faster
Use vector operations instead of loops wherever possible.
This is done by numpy and pandas.

## Takes up less space in memory usage/storage
